"""
RTNode LoRa integration test suite.

FIREWALL_MODE architecture note
---------------------------------
The RTNode runs in FIREWALL_MODE, which means serial_write() is a
compile-time no-op (Utilities.h:#ifdef FIREWALL_MODE … return;).
No KISS frame responses will ever arrive from the RTNode.  All
RTNode self-tests therefore parse the device's ASCII RNS debug log
output via KissSerial.wait_for_log_line() and .log_lines.

The RNode probe IS a standard KISS TNC and responds normally.

Test categories
----------------
  CATEGORY 1 — RTNode alive tests (RTNode serial log, no RNode needed)
    Verifies the device is running, RNS is active, and no error-level
    log entries appear during a quiet observation window.

  CATEGORY 2 — LoRa receive path  (RNode → RTNode)
    RNode sends a KISS DATA packet.  We verify the RTNode's RNS stack
    logs new activity, indicating the LoRa packet was received and
    handed to the Reticulum transport layer.

  CATEGORY 3 — LoRa transmit path  (RTNode → RNode)
    RTNode periodically transmits RNS announces and transport packets
    over LoRa.  The RNode (in promiscuous mode) watches for any
    inbound LoRa packet.

           sends the startup ``probe_destination.announce()`` over LoRa.
        2. Watch the RTNode's serial log for ``[LoRa] TXSTART`` — the
           firmware log that fires inside ``transmit()`` immediately before
           the SX126x packet is written, confirming actual RF transmission.
           (``[LoRa] TX`` fires earlier at packet-queue time and is shown
           for information only; TXSTART proves the RF actually started.)
        3. Simultaneously watch the RNode (promiscuous) for any LoRa frame.
        4. Both must succeed: RTNode logs TXSTART *and* RNode receives a packet.
